## Introduction

This backend component of the Trello Clone project serves as the backbone of the application, handling user authentication, data storage in MongoDB, and exposing API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** We've built the backend using Spring Boot, which provides a robust and scalable framework for Java applications.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is used as the database to store project boards, tasks, user information, and more.

- **WebSocket:** Real-time updates are achieved using WebSocket, allowing collaborative features and instant notifications.

- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication, ensuring secure and efficient access control.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend of the Trello Clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/trello-clone-backend.git
   cd trello-clone-backend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies by using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. Set up your MongoDB database and update the `application.properties` file with the appropriate database configuration.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

Now, the backend server should be up and running locally.

## Usage

The backend of the Trello Clone provides a set of API endpoints to manage projects, tasks, users, and real-time updates. You can integrate these endpoints with the frontend to build a fully functional Trello-like application.

## API Endpoints

For detailed documentation on API endpoints, please refer to the API documentation at `/docs` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/docs`) once the backend server is running.

## Authentication

User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens. To access protected endpoints, you need to obtain a JWT token by registering and logging in through the provided authentication endpoints.

## Database

MongoDB is used as the database for this project. Make sure to set up and configure MongoDB appropriately according to your needs.
